# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the authentication API issues in the application, specifically the HTTP 405 (Method Not Allowed) errors occurring when users attempt to login or register. The current implementation has a discrepancy between how the API routes are defined in the server and how they are being accessed by the client. This feature will ensure proper API endpoint configuration and consistent routing for authentication functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register for an account so that I can access the application's features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits registration information via the client application THEN the system SHALL process the request successfully without 405 errors
2. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL return a 201 status code with a JWT token and user information
3. WHEN registration fails due to validation errors THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with a 400 status code
4. WHEN registration fails due to server errors THEN the system SHALL return a 500 status code with an error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in to the application so that I can access my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits login credentials via the client application THEN the system SHALL process the request successfully without 405 errors
2. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with a JWT token and user information
3. WHEN login fails due to invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a 400 status code with an appropriate error message
4. WHEN login fails due to server errors THEN the system SHALL return a 500 status code with an error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent API routing between client and server so that authentication requests work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the client makes API requests to authentication endpoints THEN the system SHALL route these requests to the correct handlers
2. WHEN API routes are configured THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency between server-side route definitions and client-side API calls
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL handle authentication requests correctly in both development and production environments
4. WHEN preflight requests are made to authentication endpoints THEN the system SHALL handle CORS correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling for authentication issues so that debugging is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL return standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN client-side errors occur during authentication THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to guide troubleshooting
